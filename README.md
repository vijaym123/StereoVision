StereoVision
============
Stereo Vision is extracting 3D information from the 2d scenes captured by 2 cameras. 
The 3D information is shown in the form of Diparity Map or Depth Map. 
 
Developing a end to end product. It has the following steps :
1) Camera Caliberation 
2) Rectification
3) Finding Disparity Map
4) Depth Map
	
Programming Language : 
* Python

Libraries used:
* SimpleCV
* OpenCV
* Numpy
